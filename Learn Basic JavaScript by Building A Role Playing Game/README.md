 * Worked through the FCC tutorial up until step 74. While working through it I made notes in word document that I will neaten up and add to my DevNotes Repo later.
 
 * Taking time working through the tutorials to make sure I understand it (It is challenging).

 * Started on step 75 again, working through it slowly to understand as much as possible. Coding on the FCC website and doing it in VS Code as well to keep it for the future.
 
 * Learned about Compound Assignments, Concatenations and more about objects today. 

 * Still not done with the FCC lesson because of researching what I learned and taking notes so I could understand it better in the future when I look at my notes.

 FCC JavaScript Tutorials (Learn Introductory JavaScript by Building a Pyramid Generator)

 # 04-24-2024

 * Started the new FCC tutorial that they added to their Javascript curriculum and fisished it. 

 * In this course I learned how to work with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. It is the fundamentals of programming concepts in JavaScript

 ## Side Note

 * The code you see in the script.js file is the neat (complete) code after everything they taught me. There was a lot of editing and changing code to experiment with different lines of code and comments were removed at the end to make it look neat.

 * Finished the course on learning JavaScript by building a Pyramid Generator. It was a challenging course that they added after all the other courses and it makes sense because it explains more in detail the the original first course and gives you a better insight on JavaScript basics.
